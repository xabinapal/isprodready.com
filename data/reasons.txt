Only if you like being on call 24/7
Sure, if your definition of 'ready' is very flexible
It's ready... to break spectacularly
Ready for production? More like ready for therapy
Define 'ready'... actually, don't do it
Your QA team called, they're still laughing
It'll work fine until someone uses it
Production-ready is a state of mind
Your tests are more broken than your code
Sure, if you enjoy 3 AM debugging sessions
Have you tried turning it off and leaving it off?
Your code has more bugs than a camping trip
It's production-ready if your users enjoy surprises
Ready for production? More like ready for deprecation
Your error handling is an error in itself
Your app is like a house of cards in a hurricane
It works on my machine, and only on my machine
Your deployment strategy is 'hope and pray'
Your monitoring consists of angry customer emails
Your rollback plan is 'panic and revert everything'
Your load testing involves one user: you
Your security audit was 'we use HTTPS sometimes'
Your documentation is a single TODO comment
Your backup strategy is 'it's in the cloud somewhere'
Your error messages are more cryptic than ancient hieroglyphs
